This is my excel completion certificate 
There arefunctions every Excel user should know.

1) The SUM Function Excel’s SUM function adds values. In the screenshot below, I entered the function =SUM(B4:B7). This will add up all of the numbers in cells B4 through B7.

The SUM function in Excel Adding columns or rows of numbers is something people do so often that there is a button dedicated to the SUM function on Excel’s ribbon. Select a cell (or cells) adjacent to the numbers you want to add up then click the SUM button in the Home > Editing group whenever you need to calculate a total.

2) The AVERAGE Function The AVERAGE function returns the average, or arithmetic mean, for a group of numbers. In screenshot below, I entered the function =AVERAGE(B8:E8).

The AVERAGE function in Excel Using the AVERAGE function is a lot shorter than typing =B8+C8+D8+E8/4!

3) The COUNT Function The COUNT function returns the number of cells that contain numbers. In the screenshot below, I typed =COUNT(B8:E8) then pressed Enter.

The COUNT function in Excel Because cell C8 contains the word popcorn, the COUNT function in cell B10 returned a value of 3. There are 4 cells in the total row but only 3 of them contain numbers.

4) The MIN Function The MIN function returns the lowest number in a range. In cell B10 (below), I typed =MIN(B8:E8) and pressed Enter. The lowest value in the range is $8,495.

The MIN and MAX functions in Excel

5) The MAX Function The MAX function returns the highest number in a range. In cell B11, I typed =MAX(B8:E8) and pressed Enter. The highest value in the range is $11,844.
